            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The growing popularity of digital banking and fintech companies 
                have resulted in the breakdown of trust that younger generations 
                have with traditional banking. Banks are not keeping up with the 
                demands of more personalized experiences and inclusivity. The goal 
                of this study is to increase customer engagement in young adults by 
                catering to their curiosity for self-discovery and self-improvement. 
                This design is a mobile app quiz that gives a deeper understanding of 
                its user's personalities around money and provides personalized financial 
                solutions that increase their engagement and overall financial health. 
                By taking this quiz, users will gain insight and awareness that will 
                point them in the right direction to tools and services that will further 
                improve their financial well-being.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>Product designer <br/>
                UX researcher <br/>
                2023 <br/>
            </p>

            <h3>Problem/challenge</h3>
            <p>
                The challenge is creating a digital experience that can analyze  a user’s 
                current behavior and  engagement level with their prospective financial 
                institutions. Doing so gives them recommendations to key banking products 
                and services that will benefit their overall financial health. 
            </p>

            <h3>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                This app aims to tackle the challenges that young adults often face in the 
                banking industry. These challenges revolve around enhancing financial 
                well-being, offering tailored advice, and addressing trust issues in banking. 
                By honing in on the fundamental habits and behaviors that impact users' financial 
                health, the app takes a holistic approach to delivering personalized solutions, 
                directly addressing these pain points.

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <div class="subtitle">
                <span>Statistics</span>
            </div>
            <p>During my initial research I found these statistics that summarize how the millennial 
                generation feels about banking there expectations of the finance industry. 
            </p>

            <div class="subtitle">
                <span>Interviews</span>
            </div>
            <p> I interviewed 12 millennials over the course of 3 days to gain insight into 
                their current financial health and how they handle their money. I wanted to gauge 
                how they felt about money from different perspectives. While conducting the 
                interviews I had 4 goals that I kept in mind.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To determine how engaged user are with their finances.</li>
                <li>How important is financial education?</li>
                <li>What steps have they taken to improve financial health?</li>
                <li>What’s holding them back from achieving their financial goals?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p> The biggest takeaway from my initial research is that young adults want to 
                improve their overall financial well-being. They look at financial stability 
                from more of a holistic view, not just earning a high income. There’s also 
                investing, saving for retirement, and being prepared for uncertain emergencies. 
                This explains the rise in fintech and non-banking app usage because these 
                different channels can be used in tandem to target different financial needs.</p>

                        coupons, and cashback offers to maximize their income. This financial prudence 
                        extends to savings for short-term goals like a vacation and long-term aspirations 
                        such as buying a home. Notably, Sam is committed to financial education, expressing 
                        a strong desire to delve deeper into the intricacies of investing. Sam’s tech-savvy 
                        behavior reflects not only a modern lifestyle but also a strategic use of digital 
                        tools to manage finances and stay informed about investment options. Despite his

                        <p> Alex is a go-with-the-flow kind of person who loves diving into new ideas 
                            and opportunities. Life for Alex is a bit like a rollercoaster, thanks to 
                            project-based work that brings in income on its own schedule. Despite the 
                            unpredictable cash flow, Alex keeps  trying out different financial 
                            strategies to handle the ups and downs, but with little success. Building 
                            up an emergency fund is a top priority for Alex – a safety net for those 
                            times when projects are between paychecks. Short-term financial goals are 
                            the name of the game, fitting right in with the freelance lifestyle of 
                            tackling one project at a time. Despite his love of freelance, the stress 
                            of this inconsistent lifestyle is really weighing down his mental health. 
                            Alex wants to make changes but is overwhelmed about what to do.</p>

                The purpose of this microsite was to increase financial engagement and to 
                improve the financial well-being of its users. I would base the results of 
                this site on the number of new finance products that have been opened. Other 
                good metrics to make note of are how many customers read the email and downloaded 
                the resources offered to them.

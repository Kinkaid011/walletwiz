                have resulted in the break down of trust that younger generations 
                have with traditional banking. Banks are not keeping up with the 
                demands of more personalized experiences and inclusivity. The goal 
                of this study is to increase customer engagement in young adults by 
                catering to their curiosity for self-discovery and self-improvement. 
                This design is a mobile app quiz that gains a deeper understanding of 
                its users personality around money and provides personalized financial 
                solutions that increase their engagement and overall financial health. 
                By taking this quiz, users will gain insight and awareness that will 
                point them in the right direction to tools and services that will further 
                improve their financial well-being.

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>My biggest takeaway from my initial research is that young adults want to 
                improve their overall financial wellbeing. They look at financially stable from 
                more of a holistic view, not just earning a high income. There’s also investing, 
                saving for retirement, and being prepared for uncertain emergencies. This explains 
                the rise in fintech and non-banking app usage because these different channels can 
                be used in tandem to target different financial needs.
